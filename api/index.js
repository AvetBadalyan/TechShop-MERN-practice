// Vercel serverless entry point.
//
// Vercel treats every file under `api/` as a function and invokes the default
// export with (req, res) - an Express app is already that shape, so the whole
// API runs as a single function, with vercel.json rewriting all paths here.
//
// The app deliberately does not call listen(); the platform owns the socket.
